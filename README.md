# CMOS VLSI DESIGN LABORATORY

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the CMOS VLSI DESIGN LABORATORY, a key component of the EC605PC course within the B.Tech. III Year II Semester syllabus at JNTU Hyderabad. This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for students and enthusiasts interested in the practical aspects of CMOS VLSI design.

## Course Overview

This laboratory course focuses on the hands-on implementation and analysis of various CMOS VLSI designs, providing a foundational understanding of VLSI system design processes. All the lab experiments are performed using industry-standard tools, including Xilinx Vivado and ModelSim, ensuring that students gain relevant and valuable experience in VLSI design practices.

## Experiments

The laboratory consists of two parts, each with a selection of experiments. Students are required to complete any six experiments from each part, totaling twelve experiments.

### Part - I: HDL Implementation

1. **Logic Gates**: Implementation of all basic logic gates.
2. **Encoders and Decoders**: Design of 8-to-3 encoder (without and with priority) and 2-to-4 decoder.
3. **Multiplexers and Demultiplexers**: Design of 8-to-1 multiplexer and 1-to-8 demultiplexer.
4. **Code Converters**: Design of 4-bit binary to gray code converter.
5. **Comparators**: Design of 4-bit comparator.
6. **Full Adder**: Design using three different modeling styles.
7. **Flip Flops**: Design of SR, D, JK, and T flip flops.
8. **Counters**: Design of 4-bit binary, BCD counters (with synchronous/asynchronous reset), or any sequence counter.
9. **Finite State Machine**: Design of a finite state machine.

### Part - II: Physical Verification and Analysis

1. **Basic Logic Gates**: Layout and verification.
2. **CMOS Inverter**: Layout and analysis.
3. **NOR/NAND Gates**: CMOS layout and verification.
4. **XOR and MUX Gates**: CMOS layout.
5. **Logic Circuits**: Static/Dynamic logic circuit (register cell) layout.
6. **Latch**: Design and layout.
7. **Pass Transistor**: Layout and verification.
8. **Combinational Circuit**: Layout of any combinational circuit (complex CMOS logic gate).
